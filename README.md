HEAT
---
And the lack there of. 

Heat is a top down 2D procidjural survival game.  Players try to survive for the longest time possible.  We plan to add some simple crafting and building system.  We plan also to add creatures that spawn and try to chill the player.  A player will be able to find objects that help them survive.  More details will follow as development progresses.
